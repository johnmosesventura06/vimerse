                  any characters, names, copy, art, logos, and animation, and
                  all right, title, interest and copyrights therein, shall
                  become the property of Client upon delivery thereof in
                  accordance with the provisions hereof. In the event that the
                  videos for any reason are determined not to be a work made for
                  hire, then Vimerse hereby grants and assigns all right, title
                  and interest to the videos to Client, and VImerse will
                  promptly execute and deliver such documents as may be
                  requested by Client in order to accomplish the assignment and
                  transfer of all such right, title and interest. Without in any
                  way limiting the foregoing, Vimerse hereby waives any and all

                  106 A(e)) or other federal, state or local statute. Vimerse
                  will not mortgage, pledge, assign or otherwise encumber the
                  aforementioned sound tracks, tapes and negative and positive
                  films.

                  that may be necessary to enable the delivered videos to

                  As a Client, you alone are accountable for the Content you
                  post (whether or not they belong to you), and you are liable

                <p>
                  The media files a client wants to get edited must be uploaded
                  as a complete package. Once we confirm that all necessary
                  files and instructions are either uploaded or shared by the
                  Client, we will send an order confirmation and start editing.
                  The order confirmation will be made over an email.

                <p>
                  While we strive to deliver edited videos in two calendar days
                  since the order confirmation, this is not guaranteed. We
                  reserve the right to extend the due date for Content with over
                  90 minutes footage duration and multiple projects. If a Client
                  wants modifications such as change in category, addition of
                  features or additional file uploads/sharing to the initial
                  submission, we will delay the delivery of edited videos. Also,
                  major holidays or natural disasters may delay the delivery of
                  edited videos. We will attempt to notify Clients ahead of
                  delay, should we fail to deliver in two calendar days.

                <p>
                  The client is in charge of viewing, reviewing and commenting
                  the video project worked on by the Editor. After the delivery
                  of an edited video, a client is permitted to request free of
                  charge one 30-minute revision. Further revisions will be
                  charged on an hourly basis, unless a client has purchased
                  “unlimited revisions” add-on or purchased plans including the
                  unlimited revisions option. Any request for changes should be
                  articulated within (5) five calendar days within the delivery
                  of an edited video. Should the Client not communicate with
                  Vimerse for more (5) five calendar days since the delivery of
                  the edited video, we will consider the project complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Should a client request additional hourly revisions, purchase
                  “unlimited revisions” add-on or purchase plans including the
                  “unlimited revisions” option, we accept revisions within (12)
                  twelve calendar days from the order confirmation. If a client
                  is not completely satisfied with the production and result
                  after (12) twelve calendar days after the order confirmation,
                  Vimerse may opt to terminate the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can accept "unlimited” requests and revisions, our output
                  volume depends on many factors, namely depending on the total
                  request volume and complexity. We will do our best to work
                  with you to accommodate any priority items and your timelines
                  but our suggestion is to not use our service for time
                  sensitive requests. Your right to use the Vimerse services
                  shall terminate upon your breach of any term of this
                  Agreement.

                  Should you decide to utilize paid features of our Service, you
                  are aware that we add new products or services for extra
                  charges, or adjust fees for current services. Clients should
                  provide payment information that can authorize payment at the
                  beginning of the project. When edited videos and revised
                  videos reflecting client’s revisions are delivered, payment
                  will be processed. During the revision process Vimerse
                  reserves the right to ask the client to give the full payment
                  for the project before any other revisions can take place.

                  Money Back Guarantee – If Vimerse has made evident mistakes
                  due to neglect and has failed to demonstrate a reasonable
                  level of efforts to correct the mistakes, client can request
                  refund of the base project price within 14 days after the
                  payment processed. The client must email to info@vimerse.com.
